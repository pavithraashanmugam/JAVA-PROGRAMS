// Gymnastics judging. A gymnast&#39;s score is determined by a panel of 6 judges who each decide a
// score between 0.0 and 10.0. The final score is determined by discarding the high and low scores,
// and averaging the remaining 4. Write a program that takes 6 real command line inputs
// representing the 6 scores and prints their average, after throwing out the high and low scores.
