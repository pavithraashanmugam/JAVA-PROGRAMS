Objectives
This assignment has been designed so that you should have a good grasp on the concepts of
o Inheritance &amp; Polymorphism
o Dynamic binding
Assignment
Write a program that implements the following class hierarchy.

Where there exists a relation of inheritance between Bill and Electricity Bill.
//Class Bill should have following members
//Data member
// Reference_num //for reference number
//Member functions
//to take input of the data members; should be virtual
//Input()
//to display data members of its respective; should be virtual
// Display()
//Class Electricity_Bill should have following members
//Data members
// Units //for units
//Per_unit_price //for per unit price
//Tax //for tax
//Member functions
//to calculate total amount to be paid after deducting tax amount
//Total_amount()
//to take input of the data members of its respective and former class in the hierarchy
//; should be virtual
//Input()
//to display data members of its respective and former class in the
//hierarchy. This function will call Total_amount() and also display the Total amount of //bill.; should
//be virtual
//Display()
//Total amount of Bill is calculated as
//(Per_unit_price*Units) â€“ Tax

//You are required to call the display function and hence display the Electricity_Bill information
//polymorphically (through base class object). The information to be displayed by the display function
//of Electricity_Bill includes reference number, units, per unit price, tax and total bill amount to be
//paid.
//Output
//Please enter reference number 346
//Please enter units consumed 20
//Please enter per unit price 2
//Please enter tax amount 10
//Reference number 346
//Units 20
//Tax 10
//Per unit price 2
//Amount to be paid 30
